BadMelon consists of 4 main projects built with .Net Core, Vue and Postgres.

### Projects
Project is broken up into the following projects.

- Web: Contains the BadMelon Web UI and PWA files.
- API: Contains the back-end controller and business logic. Swagger generated by Swashbuckle and served at /api/swagger.
- Data: Contains the BadMelon business logic, database models and access logic.

### Tests
Unit test projects are built on xUnit. The intention is to have over 90% code coverage with these tests.

- Data Tests: Unit testing of the domain models and repositories. Repository tests are not meant to test Entity Framework, but are meant to test predictable issues like foreign key constraints as well as ensuring required related data is loaded
- API Tests: Integration tests that ensures endpoint functionality all the way to the database, including proper HTTP status codes.
