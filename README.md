### Projects

- Web: Contains the BadMelon Web UI and PWA files.
- API: Contains the back-end controller and business logic. Swagger generated by Swashbuckle and served at /api/swagger.
- Data: Contains the BadMelon business logic, database models and access logic.

### Tests

- Data Tests: Unit testing of the domain models and value conversions. These tests ensure the recipe/food inventory logic is working properly.
- API Tests: Integration tests that ensures endpoint functionality all the way to the database, including proper HTTP status codes. 

To generate a coverage report, execute the RunTests powershell script located in the root of the tests project.
